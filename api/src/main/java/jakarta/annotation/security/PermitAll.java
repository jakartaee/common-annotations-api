/**
 * Specifies that all security roles are allowed to invoke the specified 
 * method(s) &#8212; i.e., that the specified method(s) are "unchecked". 
 * It can be specified on a class or on methods. Specifying it on the class 
 * means that it applies to all methods of the class. If specified at the 
 * method level, it only affects that method. If the {@code RolesAllowed}
 * annotation is specified at the class level and this annotation is 
 * applied at the method level, the {@code PermitAll}
 * annotation overrides the {@code RolesAllowed} annotation for
 *  the specified method.
